// «The deadline moved — rewrite what is queued for this task.»
//
// Reminders are written down when they become knowable, not found later by a
// scan. Every server route that changes a task calls `syncIssueReminderRows`
// itself; this route exists for the one path that is not a server route. A
// task's own fields — the deadline among them — are still written straight from
// the browser through `updateDoc`, and the browser cannot touch
// `scheduledNotifications`: no Firestore rule describes that collection, so it
// is closed to everything except the Admin SDK, which is exactly right for a
// queue nobody should be able to forge a row in.
//
// So the composer writes the deadline and then asks here, and this route
// recomputes from what is actually stored rather than from anything the caller
// says. The request body carries nothing at all: there is nothing a caller
// could tell us that the task document does not already say, and a route that
// accepts a delivery time is a route that can be asked to notify anybody at any
// hour.
//
// Cost: one read of the task, two cached reads of the organization's workflow
// and timezone, one indexed query over this task's pending rows, and the writes
// the difference implies. It is paid on an action somebody just performed,
// which is the moment when a few reads are affordable and a scan is not.
