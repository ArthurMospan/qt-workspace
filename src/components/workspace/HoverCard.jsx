/**
 * The one shape a mention has, whoever it names. `IssueMentionChip` and the
 * task chat's `MentionText` wear the same one, so a mentioned task and a
 * mentioned person read alike in a sentence.
 *
 * It is an **inline-block, not a flex box**, and that is the whole trick. An
 * inline-block's baseline is the baseline of the text inside it, so the name in
 * the chip sits on exactly the line the sentence sits on — by construction,
 * with no tuned offset and nothing to drift. A flex chip has no text baseline
 * to offer (its first item is a face, not a word), so the browser synthesises
 * one from whatever that face happens to be; every previous attempt here was
 * really an attempt to guess that synthesis, and every one of them left the
 * words in the chip a pixel or two off the words around them.
 *
 * Three rules keep it that way, and breaking any of them puts the step back:
 *
 *   • No `overflow: hidden` on the chip. An inline-block that clips takes its
 *     bottom margin edge as its baseline instead of its text — which is why the
 *     label is shortened as a *string* rather than truncated as a box, by
 *     `useFittedLabel`, against the width the chip really has.
 *   • The avatar is positioned, not laid out. Out of flow it cannot touch the
 *     line box, and `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2` centres it in the chip exactly,
 *     whatever the font's metrics are.
 *   • `leading-[20px]` against the body's 14px/22.75px line. The chip's whole
 *     box then fits inside the line the sentence already occupies, so a
 *     paragraph does not grow by so much as a pixel where somebody is named.
 *
 * @param {boolean} options.dark On a dark bubble — the task chat's own messages.
 * @param {boolean} options.interactive Whether it answers to a pointer; a chip
 *   that only names somebody must not offer a hover state it cannot honour.
