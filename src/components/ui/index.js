// src/components/ui/index.js
// Centralized barrel export for all UI components
// This is the single source of truth for all component imports across the application
//
// Every name here is rendered by the product and previewed in /ui-kit. There is
// no third state: 31 components used to sit in this file exported and unused,
// which meant the barrel described an inventory nobody could see on a screen
// and half of it duplicated something already live (Avatar beside UserAvatar,
// Badge beside Pill, Chip beside Tag, Stat beside KpiCard). `npm run test:unit`
// now fails if an unused component reappears.
