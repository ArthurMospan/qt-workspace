// ─── UI Kit: Meter ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One ratio against a limit: hours burnt against a budget, subtasks finished
// against subtasks opened.
//
// The budget bar this replaces changed hue with severity — ink under 70%, then
// yellow-400, then red-500 — while the subtask bar next to it was emerald at
// every value and the workload bar mixed its own #7ba98d and #c96a5a. Three
// bars, three unrelated palettes, one question.
//
// Severity is a real thing to say, so it stays: but it is said with the status
// scale the rest of the product uses and a word beside the number, because a
// bar that is only red says "bad" to everyone except the readers who cannot see
// that it is red.

// Where the reading sits. A card gives a meter a block of its own, so the
// figure goes on its own line above the bar. A table row is one line — and a
// meter that stacked inside a 36px cell filled 34 of them, put its figure on a
// baseline nothing else in the row shared, and left the bar hard against the
// hairline below. Same meter, laid along the row instead of across it.

// that is fine says so by being neutral, and colouring "nothing is wrong" green
// spends the reader's attention on the one thing that did not need it.

  // Ordinary progress. Nothing is wrong, so nothing is coloured as though it is.
