// ─── UI Kit: File Thumb ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The little square in front of a file's name, and the only thing in the
// product that decides what a file looks like.
//
// It used to be decided three times. The task row drew an <img> for pictures and
// a grey `FileText` for absolutely everything else; the chat tile drew five
// glyphs from a map of its own; the channel's materials list drew whatever the
// chat tile drew. So a .xlsx, a .zip, a .txt and a Keynote deck were the same
// grey page in every one of them, and a video — a file that *has* a picture —
// was a page too.
//
// Here a picture shows its picture, a video shows its own first frame with the
// play badge over it, and everything else gets its family's glyph on its
// family's tint. The geometry and the eleven hues live in `globals.css` under
// `.ui-file-glyph`; this component only decides which of the three it is.

/**
 * One file, as a square: its own picture where it has one, its family's glyph
 * where it does not.
 *
 * @param {object} props.attachment The stored file record, or a picked `File`.
 * @param {string} props.previewUrl Overrides where the picture comes from — a blob URL for a file that is not uploaded yet, or a signed URL for a private one.
 * @param {'sm'|'md'|'lg'} props.density How big the square is. `md` is the list square; `sm` rides inside a chat tile.
 * @param {boolean} props.dark The square sits on a dark surface, so the tint borrows the surface's light instead of the hue's.
 * @param {string} props.className Placement in the parent only.
