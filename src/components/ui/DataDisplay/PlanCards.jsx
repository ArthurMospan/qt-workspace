/**
 * The price list. One of them, and only one.
 *
 * There used to be two, and they disagreed about the product: onboarding drew
 * three hand-built cards at $0/$9/$19 with four invented bullet points each and
 * a different accent colour per plan, while the settings screen drew the
 * registry. A person met the first on the day they signed up and the second the
 * first time they went looking for the bill, and nothing kept the two in step —
 * the prices had already drifted apart from what the product charges.
 *
 * So the price list is a component and the plans are data. Both screens pass
 * the same three things: which plan is already chosen, what to call it on its
 * own button, and what to do when another one is picked.
 *
 * ── Why the columns line up ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `grid-rows-subgrid`. The card is not a stack of blocks that happen to be the
 * same height; it is five bands — name, price, ceilings, button, what the plan
 * adds — and every band is one row of the outer grid, so its height is the
 * tallest of the three across the row. That is what puts the three prices on
 * one line and the three buttons on another, whatever any card holds. A column
 * of stacked blocks cannot do it: a tagline that wraps to two lines in one card
 * pushes that card's price down and nothing else's, which is the drift that was
 * there before — every card correct on its own and the row a staircase.
 *
 * Below `lg` there is one column and nothing to align, so the card is a plain
 * flex stack.
 *
 * @param {string} props.activePlanId The plan already in force, or already picked.
 * @param {string} props.activeLabel What its own button says — «Це ваш тариф», «Обрано».
 * @param {(planId: string) => void} props.onChoose Fires with the plan whose button was pressed.
 * @param {string} props.busyPlanId The plan being switched to right now; its button spins.
 * @param {string[]} props.lockedPlanIds Plans this screen may not choose — the second free workspace on one account.
 * @param {string} props.lockedLabel What a locked plan's button says instead of its own label.
 * @param {string} props.className Placement in the parent only.

                They used to share a flex row with the badge, which meant the
                badge stole width from the tagline for the tagline's whole
                height — so the one card that carries a badge was also the one
                whose sentence was squeezed into a column two words wide.

                The badge is black. It is the only mark the most popular plan
                gets: a card in a second colour tells somebody which one we
                would like them to buy, not which one fits. */}
