// ─── UI Kit: Attachment Row ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One attachment on a task, as a list row: what the file is, its name and size,
// and the actions that apply to it.
//
// Four hand-written controls in one row — thumbnail, name, download, delete —
// which is why this was the densest patch of native markup on the task surface.
// It lived in IssueDetail, so /ui-kit had no way to draw an attachment and no
// way to notice the row drifting from the card beside it.
//
// Two things it no longer decides for itself. What a file *looks* like is
// `FileThumb` — the same square the chat draws, so a .xlsx is a green sheet in
// both and not a grey page in both. And a sound file is not a thing you open in
// a black full-screen lightbox to hear: the row plays it where it lies, with
// the same `AudioPlayer` the chat and the client portal use.
//
// Downloading is a callback rather than an import so the kit stays clear of the
// portal's transfer code: the row decides how the control looks, the page
// decides what the click does.

 * One file on a task: what kind it is, its name and size, and the actions
 * available for it. What the actions are depends on where the row is — editing
 * a description offers "insert", an archived task offers only download.
 *
 * @param {object} props.attachment The stored file record.
 * @param {boolean} props.isEditing The description is open for editing, so inserting a link is possible.
 * @param {boolean} props.isArchived Read-only history: nothing may be deleted.
 * @param {(attachment) => void} props.onOpen Opens the file in the viewer.
 * @param {(attachment, kind, url) => void} props.onInsert Inserts a markdown link to it into the description.
 * @param {(attachmentId: string) => void} props.onDelete Removes it from the task.
 * @param {(url: string, name: string) => void} props.onDownload Downloads it.
