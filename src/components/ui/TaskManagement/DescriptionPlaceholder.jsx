// ─── UI Kit: Description Placeholder ─────────────────────────────────────────
// What a task shows where its description would be: a line of italic hint text
// that is also the button which starts editing.
//
// Not a `TextAction`. That component is a colour and a hover on top of a size,
// and every size it has is semibold — this is 13px at normal weight, italic,
// and it fades faint→muted rather than toward ink. Encoding that as a fourth
// tone plus a fifth size would put two variants in the shared component for one
// caller, which is a hardcode wearing a variant's name. A look with one owner
// belongs to the component that owns it.
