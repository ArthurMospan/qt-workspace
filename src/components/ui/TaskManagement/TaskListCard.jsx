/**
 * A titled card holding a flat list of tasks — "Прострочені", "Поточний фокус",
 * "Нещодавно закриті". The rows are `TaskRow`, so a task looks and behaves the
 * same wherever it is listed: same key, badges, assignees, overdue marker, and
 * the same click through to the task.
 *
 * Analytics used to draw three different lists of tasks. Overview had TaskRows;
 * the team pages had a priority dot with a subtitle line; "нещодавно закриті"
 * had a title, a cycle time and a pill, and could not be clicked at all. Unlike
 * `TaskListView`, this one does not group by status: the caller has already
 * decided what the list is.
 *
 * @param {string} props.title Caption above the list.
 * @param {React.ComponentType} props.icon Leading glyph on the caption.
 * @param {string} props.iconClassName Colour for that glyph, where it carries meaning.
 * @param {number} props.count Shown next to the title; defaults to the number of tasks.
 * @param {object[]} props.issues The tasks to list.
 * @param {object[]} props.allIssues Every task in scope, for parents and blockers.
 * @param {object[]} props.members Workspace members, for avatars.
 * @param {object[]} props.labels Label definitions, for the chips.
 * @param {object[]} props.sprints Sprint definitions.
 * @param {object[]} props.projects Projects, for naming each row's project.
 * @param {object[]} props.issueLinks Relations, for the blocked marker.
 * @param {boolean} props.showProjectName Whether each row names its project — true on cross-project lists.
 * @param {string} props.emptyText Sentence shown when there is nothing to list.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.action Optional control on the right of the caption.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.back The way out of a drilled-in list; it leads the caption.
 * @param {string} props.className Placement in the parent only.
