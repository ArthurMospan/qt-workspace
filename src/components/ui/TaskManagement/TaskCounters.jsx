/**
 * What a task carries, counted at the edge of its card or row: files, times you
 * were named, messages — and one dot for "something in here is new".
 *
 * The card and the row each drew this by hand, which is how they ended up
 * disagreeing about the same three facts. The unread signal in particular was
 * drawn twice on one card, once beside the key and once on the chat counter,
 * from the same comment; it is a single mark now, last in the row, and it
 * covers every kind of activity rather than messages alone.
 *
 * A mention is a counter like the others rather than a pill: it is the same
 * kind of fact — how many of a thing there are — and only its ink is different,
 * because being named is the one of the three addressed to you personally.
 *
 * It is also the last of the three. Sitting between the files and the messages
 * it read as one more piece of bookkeeping; at the end of the row, where the
 * eye stops, it reads as the thing that is addressed to you.
 *
 * The "something is new here" dot closes the row after all of them. It is not a
 * count of anything, so it does not belong in the middle of counts — it is the
 * mark you look for last, and it sits where the eye lands last.
 *
 * @param {number} props.attachments Files on the task.
 * @param {number} props.mentions Unread messages naming the current user.
 * @param {number} props.messages Messages in the task chat.
 * @param {boolean} props.unread Whether anything on the task is new to this user.
 * @param {string} props.unreadLabel What the new thing is — a comment, a status change, edits. The dot already says that there is something; the tooltip is where the reader learns what, and it is free: the task document that drew this row carries the kind of the last activity.
 * @param {'sm'|'md'} props.size `sm` for a list row, `md` for a board card.
 * @param {string} props.className Placement in the parent only.
