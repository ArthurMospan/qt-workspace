/**
 * What a task is called, above its title: its key, the parent it hangs under,
 * and the project it belongs to on a cross-project list — in that order, from
 * the task outwards. The project used to sit between the two keys, splitting
 * one thought in half with an unrelated one.
 *
 * The card and the list row each drew this by hand, and both ran the three
 * through one uppercase monospace span joined by bullets — so the project name
 * read as part of the identifier rather than as the project, and a task with no
 * key got an invented one.
 *
 * All three are monospace: two of them are identifiers, and setting the third
 * in the body face put a second typeface on a 10px line, which showed as a
 * seam rather than as a distinction. They are told apart by weight and colour
 * instead — only the card's own key carries any, and everything after it is
 * context, so the line reads as a name with its address behind it.
 *
 * Two keys sit here on a subtask, and they are not equals: the first names this
 * task, the second names the one it hangs under. They are set in the same type
 * for that reason — one kind of thing, read the same way — and told apart by
 * weight and colour alone. The parent used to be the darker and heavier of the
 * two, which read as the card's own name with something faint in front of it.
 *
 * @param {object} props.issue The task.
 * @param {object} props.project Its project, for re-prefixing a legacy key.
 * @param {string} props.projectName Its project's name.
 * @param {boolean} props.showProjectName Whether to name the project — true only on cross-project lists.
 * The key is struck through when the task is finished. Only the key: the title
 * beside it is what the task *is*, and it is as true of a finished task as of
 * an open one, while the key is the handle you reach for — and a handle you no
 * longer need is exactly what a strikethrough says. The caller decides, because
 * only it knows the workflow: «Готово» is a category, not a word.
 *
 * @param {object} props.parentIssue The task this one hangs under, if any.
 * @param {boolean} props.done Whether the task's status is in the «Готово» category.
 * @param {string} props.className Placement in the parent only.

                The parent is often unnameable from the card's own data: it may
                be in another sprint, another column, past the loaded page, or
                cancelled — cancelled work is filtered out of every stream that
                publishes issues, so the card searching the issues on screen
                will not find it. Tasks written since carry `parentIssueKey`,
                which is what names it in all of those cases; where even that is
                missing there is nothing to say, and `showsParent` says it. */}
