// The frame a task and a calendar event are both drawn in.
//
// They are the same screen — a title, the strip of attributes under it, a stack
// of sections, and on a task a conversation beside it — and they had become two
// screens that merely resembled each other. The differences were never
// decisions; they were the residue of the two files being written months apart:
//
//   • the task reserved the fixed header's 56px *above* its scroll container
//     and the event reserved it *on* the container. Padding on a scroller is
//     inside the scrollport, so the event's `sticky top-0` title parked itself
//     underneath the fixed header rather than below it. That is the "зовсім
//     інший ефект" you feel the moment you scroll either page;
//   • at ≥1024px the task stopped the page scrolling and scrolled its left
//     column instead, which is a second scroll model for the same gesture.
//
// One model now, the event page's: the page scrolls, the title sticks under the
// header, and the conversation rail is `position: sticky` at the height the
// scrollport leaves it — so it holds still and scrolls itself, which is what
// the two columns were trying to do all along.
export const CONTEXTS = {
  // A task: the reading column plus its conversation rail. It fills the page
  // gutter and nothing more — a task is two columns of live controls, not a
  // measure of prose, and capping it at 1520px parked a second, much wider
  // margin outside the standard 32px gutter on any monitor past that.
  // The room under the page is `--ui-detail-bottom` in `.ui-detail-shell`, not
  // a class here: the rail's height is measured from it too, and the two cannot
  // be allowed to disagree.

 * The scroll container, measure, sticky title and optional rail that a task and
 * a calendar event share. Everything that used to differ between the two pages
 * lives in `CONTEXTS` and in `.ui-detail-shell` — not at either call site.
 *
 * @param {'task'|'event'} props.context Which detail page: how wide the measure is, and whether there is a rail.
 * @param {boolean} props.standalone A real page under the fixed header. `false` is the dialog, which owns its own chrome and height.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.header The title and its actions. Made sticky here.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.attributes The attribute strip, given the fade that hides content sliding under the title.
 * @param {boolean} props.scrolled The content has left the top — the same flag the strip condenses on, so the fade and the strip cannot disagree.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.aside The rail beside the content — the task's conversation.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.lead A full-width row above the scroller, outside the measure: the mobile pane switch.
 * @param {'content'|'aside'} props.mobilePane Which column is on screen below 1024px. Ignored above it, where both are.
 * @param {(scrolled: boolean) => void} props.onScrolledChange Fires when the content leaves the top.
 * @param {string} props.className Placement in the parent only.
