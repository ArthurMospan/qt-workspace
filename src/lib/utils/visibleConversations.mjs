// src/lib/utils/visibleConversations.mjs
// Which conversations are open in front of the reader, as a stack.
//
// One slot was enough while one pane at a time could show a conversation. It
// is not: a task opens as a window over the workspace chat, and closing that
// window used to leave the slot empty — the channel underneath was still on
// screen, the system no longer knew it, and the next message in it rang and
// drew a card over the very conversation it described. The topmost entry is
// what the reader is looking at; closing it reveals the one below.
//
// Pure: the store applies these, and the tests exercise them without React.
