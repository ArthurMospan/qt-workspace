// Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions matrix
//
// One rule about this file: an entry describes what the product actually
// enforces, never what someone once meant it to enforce. Firestore rules and
// the server routes are authoritative; when they disagree with an entry here,
// the entry is the bug. Two entries have already drifted that way, so every
// permission below names the route or rule that backs it.

export const PERMISSIONS = {
  // Projects
  'create:project': ['owner', 'admin'],
  'delete:project': ['owner', 'admin'],
  'edit:project_settings': ['owner', 'admin'],

  // Board configuration is not a permission of its own: the columns live in
  // project settings, behind `edit:project_settings`, and the entry that used to
  // sit here was a second name for the same gate that nothing ever called.

  // Sprints
  'manage:sprints': ['owner', 'admin'], // Створення/старт/завершення спринтів

  // Team
  //
  // `manage:team` is the invitation and project-team permission — it is not
  // one undivided "team management" right, because the product splits it:
  // inviting and deactivating are owner+admin, ownership is the owner's alone.
  'manage:team': ['owner', 'admin'],          // Запрошення, склад команди проєкту
  'manage:member_roles': ['owner', 'admin'],  // member ↔ admin, /api/organizations/[id]/members/[memberId]
  'deactivate:member': ['owner', 'admin'],    // Забрати доступ, лишивши дані
  'transfer:ownership': ['owner'],            // /api/organizations/[organizationId]

  // Finance
  //
  // Owner *and* admin, because that is what the product actually enforces:
  // `firestore.rules` lets an org admin read an invoice, `/api/invoices`
  // authorises `['owner', 'admin']`, and the analytics tab has always shown the
  // «Рахунок» section to both. This entry said `owner` alone and was never
  // called by anything — the screen rolled its own check — so the matrix
  // documented a restriction the product did not have. Rules are authoritative;
  // the matrix follows them.
  'manage:finance': ['owner', 'admin'], // Рахунки, ставки, чужі табелі

  // Issues
  //
  // A member may delete a task in a project they belong to. Access to the
  // project is what grants it, exactly as in Linear and Asana: the alternative
  // — a typo that only an administrator can clear — is not a safety property,
  // it is a queue. The task lands in the trash either way and can be restored.
  // Project scope is enforced server-side in /api/issues/[issueId] and
  // /api/issues/bulk; being a member of the organization is not enough.

 * The same question, asked while the role is still on its way.

 * `can(null, action)` is `false`, and a screen that hides a control on `false`
 * cannot tell "you may not" from "we do not know yet". For an owner-only action
 * that conflation is harmless — hiding it a moment longer is the safe way to be
 * wrong. For an action every role in the workspace holds it is never anything
 * but wrong: the comment composer simply was not on the task screen until the
 * membership arrived, and the person waiting for it had no way to know whether
 * they were early or forbidden.
 *
 * So while the role is unknown this answers for the floor — the least any
 * member of this organization holds. Nobody who is in the workspace at all is
 * denied `create:comment`, so nobody is shown a control they will lose; and
 * `create:project`, which a member does not hold, still stays hidden until the
 * role proves otherwise. The write itself is authorized by Firestore rules and
 * the server routes either way; this decides only what is on screen.
 *
 * @param {string|null} role - The role, or null/undefined while it loads.
 * @param {string} action - The action to check permission for.
 * @returns {boolean} True if allowed, or still possible for any member.
