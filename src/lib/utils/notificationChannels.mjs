// preferences document answers "send this notification type to this channel?".
//
// Pure and dependency-free on purpose: the settings UI, the notifications API
// route and the Telegram sender all have to agree, and before this module they
// did not. Each channel had its own rule buried in whichever file delivered it —
// a single set of per-event switches gated the notification record, email then
// silently dropped every type outside a hardcoded list, and Telegram received
// everything that had been created with no per-event control at all. None of
// that was visible in Settings, so the page promised choices it did not make.
