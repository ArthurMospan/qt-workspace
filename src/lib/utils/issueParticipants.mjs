// src/lib/utils/issueParticipants.mjs
// Who hears about activity on a task.
//
// The rule every issue tracker converges on, and the one people already expect:
// you are a participant if you have a stake in the task — you created it, it is
// assigned to you, you are watching it, or you joined the conversation by
// commenting. Activity goes to participants and never back to whoever caused it.
//
// Before this existed each sender picked its own audience. A status change went
// to assignees and watchers only, so the person who *created* the task never
// heard that it moved, and comments notified nobody at all unless they carried
// an @mention.

  // @mentioned gets the mention, not a second, vaguer notification as well.
