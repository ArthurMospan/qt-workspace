// src/lib/utils/notificationPresence.mjs
// Whether a notification is about the conversation already on the reader's
// screen — and what follows from that for the record in the bell.
//
// The live popup announces what has just arrived, and on a task page it was
// announcing messages into the very chat it then covered: you watched somebody
// type, saw their message land in the thread, and were told about it a second
// later by a card sitting on top of it. A notification whose conversation the
// reader is looking at has nothing left to tell them, so the popup stays down —
// the record in the bell is written either way, because the bell is the log.
//
// The same question decides whether that record is *unread*. It is one rule,
// and it used to be three: the popup asked `isConversationOnScreen` for every
// type, the task page marked three types read, the chat page marked two — so a
// status change on the task you were reading was silenced and left unread at
// once, the counter rose and nothing explained why. `settleRecordsOnScreen`
// below is the one answer, and `useNotifications` is the one caller.
//
// Pure: the workspace bridge decides with it, and the tests exercise it without
// a browser.

 * direction: the reader opens a conversation whose records already sit in the
 * bell, and they are read the moment the pane says it is showing them.
 *
 * Returns the same array when nothing changed, so a caller that keys work on
 * the reference does nothing when no record actually flipped.
