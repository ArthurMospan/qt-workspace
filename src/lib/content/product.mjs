// One source for the version, readable from three places that do not share a
// module system: Node (tests import this file directly), the Next server, and
// the browser bundle. `createRequire` covered the first two and broke the
// third — the moment a client component reached this module, `node:module`
// went into the browser chunk and the build failed outright. A JSON import
// with an explicit type attribute is understood by Node and by the bundler.
