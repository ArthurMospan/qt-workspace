// These are increments on `projects/{id}`, and Firestore sustains roughly one
// write per second on a single document — worth checking against before it
// ships rather than after.
//
// The project document is already the serialization point for almost every task
// mutation in a project: creating a task bumps `issueCounter` on it, a status
// change bumps `issueStatusVersion`, deleting one bumps `issueHierarchyVersion`,
// and a time log writes it twice over. Adding three counters to writes that
// were already touching this exact document cannot make its throughput worse.
//
// The one place that deliberately does *not* write it per task is the bulk
// route, which found out the hard way that fifty concurrent transactions on one
// project document serialise the whole operation behind a hot row. So bulk
// accumulates its deltas across the loop and commits them once, in the same
// batch that touches `updatedAt` — one write per project, not one per task.

 * Vercel Hobby allows one cron a day, and a sub-daily entry in `vercel.json`
 * stops deployments being created at all.
 *

 * door, in every tab. `select()` keeps the payload to the eight fields a count
 * depends on; it does not reduce the read count, because nothing does.
