// Where a ceiling becomes a refusal.
//
// The price list said «10 учасників» for months and nothing counted them. Three
// of the registry's ceilings now have a route that says no, and all three say
// no through this file, so a plan cannot be enforced in one place and forgotten
// in another — and cannot be worded differently either, because the sentence
// comes from the registry rather than from the route.
//
// ── The counter on the organization, and what it is not ─────────────────
//
// Every refusal here counts for real at the moment of the write: the project
// transaction counts projects, the invitation counts memberships, the AI route
// reads its own tally inside a transaction. `usage` on the organization
// document is written alongside as a **display cache** — it is what lets a
// button look refused before it is pressed and a strip appear on a screen that
// has loaded nothing but the organization. Nothing is decided from it. A client
// that wrote a smaller number into it would change what it sees and nothing
// about what it is allowed to do.
