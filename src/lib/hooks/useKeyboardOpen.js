// chrome — the URL bar, the toolbar, the home indicator — which is why a fixed
// bottom bar behaves without any inset arithmetic. The keyboard is the
// exception: depending on the platform and the `interactive-widget` mode it
// either hides a fixed element behind itself or leaves it floating on top, and
// both look like a bug. visualViewport is the only API that reports the box
// that is actually visible.
//
// The threshold is a fraction rather than a pixel count so it holds on a small
// phone and on a tablet: a collapsing URL bar costs well under a fifth of the
// height, a keyboard costs a third or more.

  // `--qt-keyboard-inset` is the second half of that: the measured overlap, for
  // the one box still entitled to subtract it.
  //
  // Below md nothing subtracts it any more, and that is deliberate. `dvh`
  // accounts for the browser's chrome but not for the keyboard, so on iOS a
  // full-height shell keeps its box while the bottom third of it is covered —
  // and WebKit already knows that. On focus it scrolls the ancestor scrollers
  // and pans the visual viewport down until the field is out from under the
  // keys. A shell that then shortens itself by the same overlap corrects a
  // second time for a keyboard that has already been paid for: the field lands
  // a keyboard's height above the visible window, and the overlap it vacated is
  // a bare strip any drag can find. A Dialog does neither, which is why the same
  // editor behaves inside one; below md the shell now does neither either.
  //
  // At md and above the subtraction stays, on `body` (globals.css). That is the
  // tablet case — an iPad in portrait is 768pt wide, past this line, and its
  // keyboard does trip the fraction below.
