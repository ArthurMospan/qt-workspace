/**
 * A period's daily totals — one document per project per day.
 *
 * Cost is the number of days on screen, not the amount of work done in them.
 * «За 90 днів» across an active team is thousands of time logs and at most
 * ninety small documents per project; this reads the second thing.
 *
 * A single read rather than a live subscription, and deliberately so. A report
 * is a reading taken at a moment: nothing on this screen is acted on the way a
 * board card or a message is, and a figure that rewrites itself while somebody
 * is looking at it is a distraction rather than a feature. The screen says when
 * it was taken and offers to take another — see `readAt` and `refresh`.
 *
 * Pass no `dayRange` and nothing is read at all. That is how a screen whose
 * current tab is about records rather than sums — «Табель», «Рахунок» — avoids
 * paying for totals it will not draw.
 *
 * Asking a new question and asking the same one again are different events, and
 * they look different. A new period or a new project selection clears what is on
 * screen and shows a spinner, because the old figures answered something else.
 * Pressing refresh leaves them exactly where they are and reports `refreshing`,
 * because they are still the right figures until better ones arrive — and a
 * report that blanks itself for half a second every time somebody checks for
 * newer numbers teaches people not to check.
