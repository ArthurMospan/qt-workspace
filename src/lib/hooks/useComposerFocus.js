// `useKeyboardOpen` answers a different question — how much of the viewport the
// on-screen keyboard is covering — and it answers it late and conditionally: it
// cannot fire until the keys have already begun covering the screen, it ignores
// an overlap under a third of the viewport (a landscape phone, an iPad's split
// keyboard, a hardware one), and it says «closed» the moment the keyboard is
// dismissed while the field still holds the caret. The bar is not about the
// keyboard. Somebody writing a message is not navigating, and the bar's 78px is
// the difference between one visible message and three.
//
// The composer is identified by the shelf it sits on. `.chat-composer-dock` is
// the class every composer in the product already wears — workspace chat, its
// threads, a task's timeline, the QuickTeam+ panel — so one listener here covers
// all four, and a composer added later inherits this by being a composer.

    // still in its composer unmounts the dock exactly that way, and on iOS a tap
    // on a <button> moves no focus either, so nothing would ever correct the
    // flag and the bar would stay gone across the whole app. `pointerdown`
