/**
 * One subscription, three readings of it.
 *
 * `issues` is the working set — what is being worked on now. Archived tasks are
 * not in it, so boards, counts, workload and progress do not carry work nobody
 * is doing.
 *
 * `allIssues` includes them, because a task leaving the present does not leave
 * the past: hours recorded against it are still hours somebody worked, and an
 * invoice built without them would quietly bill less than was done. Anything
 * reasoning about what *happened* reads this one; anything reasoning about what
 * is *open* reads the other.
 *
 * A cancelled task is in neither. Work that is not going to happen is not part
 * of the present and did not happen in the past, so it is filtered out here
 * rather than at each of the several dozen places that would otherwise have to
 * remember. `cancelledIssues` is what «Архів» → «Скасовані» lists, and the only
 * reader that gets them.
 *
 * ── Вікно часу ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Tasks are a bounded set: one document per piece of work, and a workspace has
 * as many as it has work. Time logs are not. One is written every time somebody
 * stops a timer — daily, per person, forever — and the screen that said «за 30
 * днів» used to read all of them and drop the rest in the browser.
 *
 * So `timeLogWindow` is not optional when time logs are wanted: the caller says
 * which period it is about to draw, and that period becomes a bound in the
 * query. Without one this hook reads no logs at all and reports the misuse,
 * rather than quietly falling back to the whole history — that fallback is
 * precisely the bug this exists to prevent.
 *
 * The tasks and the logs are two effects rather than one, because they move on
 * different clocks. The task set changes when the project scope changes; the
 * log window changes whenever somebody picks another period or pages the
 * timesheet back a week. Sharing one effect meant every period change tore down
 * and re-read every task in the organization to answer a question about hours.
 *
 * ── Живе чи разове ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `live` decides whether these are subscriptions or one reading.
 *
 * A live listener is worth its cost where somebody is acting on the data as it
 * changes: a board they are dragging cards on, a task two people are editing,
 * a conversation. A report is not that. Nobody drags anything on «Огляд»; the
 * numbers are read, and a figure that rewrites itself mid-sentence is a
 * distraction rather than a service — and it is a distraction that keeps a
 * listener open over the largest collections the product has, for as long as
 * the tab is left on screen.
 *
 * So the report screens ask for `live: false`: one read, a `readAt` to say when
 * it was taken, and `refresh` for when somebody wants a newer one. The board,
 * «Мої завдання» and the sprint screens keep the live default, because there
 * the data is the thing being worked on.
