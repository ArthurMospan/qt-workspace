// scripts/kit-composition.mjs — the named size contracts, as declared.
//
// The kit writes composition geometry in `globals.css` under `@layer components`
// and means it to be the one place that geometry lives. Half of what those rules
// declared never reached the screen, and nothing said so.
//
// The reason is cascade layers, not specificity. `.ui-control[data-ui-composition=…]`
// is a class plus an attribute — 0,2,0 — and beats `.px-4` at 0,1,0 easily. But
// Tailwind emits `@layer theme, base, components, utilities;`, and **layer order
// wins over specificity**: a utility in the last layer beats any rule in an
// earlier one. The moment `Button` writes `px-4` in its own class list, every
// `padding` a composition declares for it is dead — silently, with the rule
// still in the file looking like the source of truth.
//
// Custom properties are the exception, which is why `--ui-control-height` is
// the one part of these presets that always worked: no utility sets it.
//
// This module only *enumerates* what the stylesheet declares, which is exact.
// Whether a declaration survives the cascade is decided in a browser, by
// tests/visual/ui-kit.spec.mjs — the first version of this file guessed at it
// from a table of utility prefixes and was wrong twice in one session:
//
//   • it matched quotes with a regex, so an apostrophe in a comment ("the
//     component's own height") opened a string that swallowed the class lists
//     after it. Adding JSDoc to Button made every `bg-*` utility vanish from
//     the token set, and the report changed without the code changing.
//   • it could not tell an unconditional utility from a variant or a branch.
//     `hover:bg-canvas` shadows nothing at rest; `bg-red-50` shadows only a
//     field in error. Both were counted, and the culprit named was often not
//     the one that actually wins.
//
// `getComputedStyle` has neither problem: it reports what the browser resolved.
