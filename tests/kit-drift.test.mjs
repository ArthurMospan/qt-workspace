// A shared CSS namespace has no per-component owner: `.ui-control[data-ui-composition]`

// report. The usage scan stops at the kit boundary on purpose, so moving a
// component into `src/components/ui` takes its call site out of view — and with
// it, the evidence for every variant that call site was the only user of.
//
// `UserStatusDialog` is the live example and the reason this number is pinned.
// It is the sole user of `Input composition="status-entry"`, `Button
// composition="status-submit"` and `Dialog size="status"`; promoting it to the
// kit would move three variants into this list while the product went on
// rendering them every time somebody set a status. A component whose call site
// is the only evidence for a declared variant stays where it is.
//
// Raised 96 → 100 when the calendar's day cell arrived. That is a different
// cause and worth naming, because the number no longer means only one thing:
// the scan can read a literal and nothing else, so a state chosen at runtime —
// `state={!inMonth ? 'outside' : isToday ? 'today' : …}` — is invisible to it
// however plainly the product renders it. Four states of `CalendarDayCell` went
// into this list on the day they started being drawn. Where a literal is
// available the call site should pass one instead of spending the ceiling;
// where the value is genuinely computed, this is the honest place for it.
//
// Raised 100 → 107 when the page skeletons were removed. `PageSkeleton` was the
// only product user of most of `Skeleton`'s presets — dot, chip, card, tile,
// chart, panel and the rest existed to draw the shape of a whole screen. The
// route loaders are a spinner now, so the sidebar is the last caller and it
// asks for two presets. The presets stay declared: they are the component's
// vocabulary, and `preset="text"` / `width="full"` are its own defaults, which
// cannot be deleted for want of a call site.
// Raised 107 → 109 with the analytics vocabulary. Both additions are a
// component's own default — `DetailSection density="section"` and
// `FileThumb density="md"` — which no call site passes and none should, for the
// same reason `Skeleton preset="text"` does not: a default is the value you get
// by writing nothing.
// Raised 109 → 111 by the calendar's phone month. `CalendarDayCell` gained
// `state="selected"` — the day whose entries are open under the grid — and a
// second geometry, whose `roomy` is the default the timesheet gets by writing
// nothing. Neither can ever be counted: `state` is not a variant prop name the
// scan reads, so every state of both calendar components has always lived in
// this list, and a default has no call site by definition.
