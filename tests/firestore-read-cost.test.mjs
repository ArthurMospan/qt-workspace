// capsule. A badge that subscribed to a whole channel's history, once per card.
// An audit log that read four hundred documents and kept fifty. None of those
// looked expensive at the call site, and none of them was caught by review.
//
// So the rule is mechanical: a live listener over a collection is bounded, by
// `limit()`, or it is named here with the reason it cannot grow. Adding a
// listener is a cost decision, and this is where that decision is recorded.
