// The permission matrix and the routes that are supposed to describe it.
//
// `src/lib/utils/can.js` opens by saying what it is for: «A route spelling its
// own list out is the drift this file exists to prevent.» Three routes call
// `rolesFor()`. Thirty-seven write `['owner', 'admin']` in the argument list.
//
// That is not, today, a hole — the lists happen to agree with the matrix. It is
// the kind of thing that becomes a hole quietly: change `create:project` to
// include members and the button appears while the server still refuses, and
// nothing in the repository notices, because the two halves never look at each
// other. AGENTS.md already states the invariant — «A change to a Firestore rule
// or a route's `allowedRoles` updates the matrix in the same change» — and this
// is what asks for it.
//
// Rewriting all thirty-seven call sites was the other option and is the worse
// one: choosing which action each route means is a judgement, and a route
// labelled with the wrong action gives the right answer today and the wrong one
// after the next edit. A literal that is checked against the matrix is honest.
// A wrong name is not.
