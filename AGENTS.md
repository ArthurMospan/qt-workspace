# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# QuickTeam repository instructions

This is a single Next.js 16.3.0 App Router application with React 19 and Firebase. Read [README.md](README.md) before changing the project.

## Where things are written down

Six documents, and nothing else. A plan, a session report or a description of
work already done is not one of them — that history belongs in Git.

| Document | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [README.md](README.md) | Setup, environment, commands, data model, security model |
| **AGENTS.md** (this file) | The rules a change must obey |
| [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | How the task model, view state, read state and notification delivery actually work |
| [docs/UI_KIT_CONTRACT.md](docs/UI_KIT_CONTRACT.md) | The shared-UI contract and its generated reports |
| [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) | Product guardrails and confirmed open work |
| [docs/MIGRATIONS.md](docs/MIGRATIONS.md) | Runbooks for the one-time data migration scripts |

Cross-repository contracts live in `docs/integrations/` (QuickTeam+, Telegram,
YouTrack). Add a seventh document only when a subject genuinely has no home
above — a new file is a place for the next reader not to look.

## Framework and commands

- This is not the older Next.js API you may remember. Before changing routes, rendering, caching, metadata, proxy behavior, or other framework APIs, read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and heed deprecations.
- Authenticated routes live under `src/app/(app)`. API routes live under `src/app/api`. Request interception lives in `src/proxy.js`; do not reintroduce `middleware.js`.
- Use `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`, and `npm run build` as separate checks. Next.js does not run lint as part of the build.
- `.github/workflows/checks.yml` asks all of them on every push and pull request, together with the rules suite and a check that the generated reports match the code. Every "`npm run test:unit` fails while…" in this file is a claim that workflow now makes true; before it existed they held only while somebody remembered to run the command.
- Firestore rule changes require `npm run test:rules:emulator`.
- After changing shared UI usage, run `npm run kit:scan` and commit the generated report when it changes.

## Architecture and security invariants

- `issues` is the canonical task collection. `tasks` is legacy/read-only; do not build new functionality on it.
- Archiving, cancelling and deleting a task are three mechanisms and must stay three: `archivedAt` (reversible, no expiry, `src/lib/utils/issueArchive.mjs`), `cancelledAt` (reversible, no expiry, `src/lib/utils/issueCancel.mjs`) and the `deletedIssues` tombstone (24-hour window, `src/lib/utils/issueTrash.mjs`). In user-facing copy the third one is «Нещодавно видалене», never «Кошик».
- An archived task leaves the present and stays in the past. Anything counting open work — boards, lists, My Tasks, workload, project progress, search, deadline reminders — excludes it. Anything describing work already done — the timesheet, the invoice, a task's own page — must still include it, or hours vanish from a bill. `useWorkspaceAnalytics` publishes both: `issues` is the working set, `allIssues` is the whole record. Pick deliberately; a new reader of issues that picks neither is a bug.
- A cancelled task leaves both. Work that is not going to happen is not open and did not happen, so it is filtered out at every stream that publishes issues — `useIssues`, `useAllMyTasks`, `useWorkspaceAnalytics`, the home screen, search, reminders, calendar deadlines — and never reaches a reader that would have to remember to subtract it. The two readers that do see one are the task's own screen (its link must keep working) and «Налаштування» → «Архів» → «Скасовані», through `cancelledIssues`. Cancelling is refused for a task whose hours are already fixed into an invoice: that work is settled and can only be archived.
- A sprint belongs to the organization, not to a project: it has `organizationId` and no project field, and tasks from any project may point at it through `issue.sprintId`. Any number of sprints may be active at once. Do not add a rule about how many, or about which projects a sprint may contain — how a team runs its sprints is the team's decision.
- A status has a local label and a shared `category` (`backlog` | `todo` | `in-progress` | `review` | `done`). Cancelling is deliberately not among them — it is a property of the task, not a place in the workflow, because a task in a column is still one of the tasks the numbers are about. `src/lib/utils/statusCategories.mjs` is the only place that decides what a category means, which statuses close a task, and which status a category resolves to in a given project. Never re-derive any of that: do not read `isDone` directly, do not compare against the id `'backlog'`, `'in-progress'` or `'done'`, and do not infer meaning from a status's position in the list. `isDone` is written as a consequence of the category, never as a second opinion about it.
- Anything that spans projects groups by category, never by status name: a status one project has hidden is not a column another project's cards can be dropped into. A drop on a category column writes a status of that category from the task's own project.
- The organization roles are `owner`, `admin`, and `member`. Client collaboration lives in QuickTeam+, not in the internal workspace.
- `src/lib/utils/can.js` is the permission matrix and it describes what the product enforces, not what someone intended. A change to a Firestore rule or a route's `allowedRoles` updates the matrix in the same change; an entry no call site reads is a claim nothing tests.
- Access is `orgMemberships` plus `project.team`, and nothing else. Removing someone closes both and archives the seat under `orgMembershipArchive` — never edit `assigneeIds`, `watcherIds`, comments or time logs to "clean up" after a person. That is the record of what happened, and rewriting it is how a workspace loses its own history.
- Firestore rules are authoritative. Client permission checks and hidden UI are only defensive.
- Privileged creation/deletion of projects, issues, memberships, invitations, and API keys must go through authenticated server routes.
- Keep all organization-scoped reads and writes constrained by membership and organization/project scope.
- Run data migrations only through reviewed, idempotent Admin SDK scripts against an explicit Firebase project. Never trigger migrations during browser login.
- Keep organization deletion disabled until a tested owner-only server cascade safely handles Firestore and external assets.
- Drag-and-drop writes must update the optimistic overlay before awaiting Firestore and must roll back on failure.
- Use the shared UI in `src/components/ui`. `Dialog` is the common modal shell; the live `/ui-kit` route and its generated usage report are the component source of truth.
- Treat the authenticated workspace and `/ui-kit` as one UI contract. A change to a shared component must update its live workspace usage and its `/ui-kit` preview in the same change.
- A new reusable visual component must be created under `src/components/ui`, exported from `src/components/ui/index.js`, used by the product, and rendered in `/ui-kit` in the same change. Do not add unused showcase-only components.
- The catalogue is a directory: `src/app/ui-kit/page.js` is the shell (navigation and `SECTION_MAP`), and every section is a story file at `src/app/ui-kit/sections/<section-id>.jsx` whose name matches its navigation id. A preview counts when the component is imported and rendered inside that story file — helpers in the same file count too. Shared preview furniture lives in `preview.jsx` and `demo-data.js` and grants no coverage on its own. `scripts/ui-kit-showcase.mjs` is the only place that knows this layout.
- `/ui-kit` is the only reference page, and it is a catalogue of components. A report is a generated JSON file and a failing test, never a screen in the catalogue.
- A component the product does not use is deleted, not kept for later. `npm run test:unit` fails while anything in `src/components/ui` is unreachable. A component reached only through another kit component (TopHeader renders Breadcrumb) counts as used and is previewed by its host.
- A screen whose layout differs is a named context on a shared layout component, not hand-written markup. Settings, Team and Chat all render `SidebarLayout` with `context="settings" | "team" | "chat"`; the gutter, the rail width and the 56px header offset live in `CONTEXTS` and nowhere else.
- Do not introduce a local component or visual pattern that is merely similar to an existing UI Kit component. Reuse the shared component, add an explicit named context/size/preset, or mark and document the intentional local exception in `docs/UI_KIT_CONTRACT.md`.
- After changing product UI, shared UI, or UI Kit previews, run `npm run kit:scan`, then `npm run kit:drift`, then `npm run kit:audit` (that order — the later two read the earlier output), and commit all three generated reports when they change.
- Every colour that is styling comes from a token in `@theme`: the brand scale (`ink`, `ink-hover`, `canvas`, `surface`, `line`, `line-strong`, `selected`, `muted`, `placeholder`, `faint`, `ink-soft`, `surface-dark`), the four status scales (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`, each in three roles — the ink that carries text and clears AA on white, the `-solid` fill, the `-soft` wash), or the chart tokens. Never a raw hex, never a Tailwind palette colour, and inside the sidebar never a brand token — a rail is branded by the organization, so everything in it reads `--sb-bg`/`--sb-text`/`--sb-muted`/`--sb-hover`/`--sb-active`. `npm run kit:colors` enforces this and `npm run test:unit` fails on a single hardcoded colour. The scan walks the kit as well as the screens (`includeSharedUi: true`) and a test holds it there — it read only the screens once, and reported zero while fifty-nine raw colours shipped inside `src/components/ui`. Each status scale also has an `-on-dark` role for the sidebar, the toast and the dark counters, where the ink and the solid are both mixed for white and go muddy. Colour that is *data* — a palette offered to somebody, a status/type/priority colour out of the database, a `canvas` fill, a generated QR, the invoice print document — is legal and listed by file with its reason in `scripts/kit-colors.mjs`.
- A variant is declared by the implementation, never by a list. `scripts/kit-variants.mjs` derives the manifest from component lookup maps and `data-ui-*` rules in `globals.css`; `/ui-kit` → «Матриця варіантів» renders every declared value. Adding a variant therefore means adding a map entry or a CSS rule — never a hand-written preview.
- `kit:drift` enforces three zeros: no variant value the manifest does not declare, no component prop outside the manifest, and no `className` on a kit component that redefines its geometry or typography. `npm run test:unit` fails if any becomes non-zero.
- `kit:drift` enforces a fourth zero: every variant the product ships is visible in the catalogue. «Матриця варіантів» renders each declared value from the manifest, so adding a variant creates its preview; a component that cannot stand alone must be listed in `VARIANT_ELSEWHERE` with the section that does show it.
- Do not document a command, report, or screen that does not exist. `npm run test:unit` resolves every `npm run …` named in this file and in `docs/UI_KIT_CONTRACT.md` against `package.json`.
- The reports cannot see that a control moved four pixels. `npm run test:visual` photographs every `/ui-kit` section and diffs it against a committed baseline. Baselines live in `tests/visual/__screenshots__`, are rendered by the `UI Kit screenshots` workflow on Linux, and are never written from a developer machine — locally the same command runs as a smoke test with pixel comparison off. Accept a deliberate visual change by running that workflow with `update_baselines`, which commits the new PNGs.
- Geometry, spacing and type scales belong in `globals.css` behind a named `composition`; do not reintroduce a free-value prop (`iconSize`, a raw avatar pixel size) that lets a call site hold its own copy of a kit decision.
- Positioning a component in its parent (`flex-1`, `h-full`, margins) is legitimate composition and is reported as benign. Redefining the component itself is not.
- QuickTeam+ uses a secondary Firebase app and a sealed server-side grant. Follow [docs/integrations/QUICKTEAM_PLUS.md](docs/integrations/QUICKTEAM_PLUS.md).

## Repository hygiene

- Будь-яка зміна видимої користувачеві поведінки, назви, дозволів або workflow оновлює відповідну статтю довідки в тому самому PR. Довідка не може описувати функцію, якої продукт не має.
- Новини (`NEWS_ARTICLES`) НЕ оновлюються з кожною зміною. Список навмисно порожній, поки продукт у беті: це матеріал для читача, а не журнал комітів. Додавати запис — тільки коли про це попросили явно.
- Контакти підтримки беруться лише з перевірених даних OneB (`supportContacts.mjs`). Не вигадувати username, Viber URI чи адресу — «контакт скоро» теж не варіант.
- Юридичні сторінки (Terms, Privacy, Offer) не заповнюються вигаданими реквізитами. Немає реальних даних — сторінка не публікується.
- Масовими не робляться дії, що залежать від контексту однієї задачі: перенесення між проєктами, зміна ієрархії, створення звʼязків, списання часу, редагування опису чи коментарів. `ISSUE_BULK_ACTIONS` — єдиний реєстр того, що є масовим, і він живить UI, серверну валідацію й довідку одночасно.

- Never commit `.env*`, service-account keys, build output, logs, or local agent scratch data.
- Keep durable setup and architecture documentation under `docs/`. Do not add generated reports, session notes, or temporary plans to the repository root.
- Preserve user changes and verify references before deleting source files.
